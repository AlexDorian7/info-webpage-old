    <h1>Thee Omega's DMing Services website proposal</h1>
    <hr />

    <h2 class="underline">Snapshot</h2>
    <p>Adam has over 40 years experience at Dungeon Matering for Dungeons and Dragons. He is looking for a first time
        website for his D&D groups that he heads. Adam needs a
        website that attrach potential new players while providing the information needed to the returning ones.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2 class="underline">Business Needs</h2>
    <p>The website needs to fulfil the following business needs:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Reach a wider base of D&D fans to widen his base of DMing opening up more opprotunities for campaigns and
            other table time.</li>
    </ol>
    <hr />

    <h2 class="underline">Audience Needs</h2>
    <p>The target audience for Adam's website is defined as potential and returning D&D players<br />
        The website needs to assist the target audience to do the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Assist in finding a compatible group.</li>
        <li>Assist in creating or forming a new group.</li>
        <li>Assisting in answering any questions that a new group may have with Official dungeons and drgaons
            information.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The website should be a useful resource for existing players, potential new players, and potential new partners.
    </p>
    <hr />

    <h2 class="underline">Solution</h2>
    <p>I recommend the development of a website from scratch that will show the value Adam's Campaigns add to the value
        of its members.</p>
    <p>The new website will be designed to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Inform the target audience of who Adam is and the services he offers</li>
        <li>Provide the target audience with information on how to contact Adam for more details on his services</li>
        <li>Provide the target audience with a common space for information about Adam and the games he runs</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The site will be made from scratch using some frameworks as a base. The site will employ modern day tools and
        skills to create a reactive webpage that conveys the information needed while looking pleasing with a unique
        style.</p>
